# TODO

## test on prod




## bugs / needs fixing

allow user to use waverunner while library is being created, but library being created should remain unavailable until its done being created


## changes / small new features

export media covers zip

personal movie/show ratings

switch to skeleton loaders

button somewhere to open source folders, maybe some as well per media

display images (png, jpg, webp, gif, etc) in extras, alongside the video extras (featurettes, webisodes, deleted scenes, etc). Right now the extras scanner only picks up VIDEO files in the reserved extra dirs (collect_extra_files filters is_media_file(VIDEO_EXTENSIONS)); extend it to also collect image files (IMAGE_EXTENSIONS) and store them as extras with a type/kind that distinguishes image vs video. The extras dialog then renders image extras in an image viewer / gallery (lightbox) instead of launching the player, while video extras keep playing as they do now. Use case: promotional stills, behind-the-scenes photos, concept art, posters. (Covers/backgrounds folders are already handled separately as artwork — this is images that live in the extra-content folders, or a dedicated images/stills folder.)


## new features

save cover sets. users should be able to save a set of media covers so that they can easily switch all media covers in a library to the saved set. 

add warnings about tv episodes without episode numbers (they will likely play out of order)

need to consider some sort of ability to queue up things for the player. TV show autoplay should probably take this system into heavy consideration. Users should be able to queue playlists. Users should be able to queue up individual movies in context menus at their whim. On the player and maybe not on the player, the user should be able to view the queue and manipulate it in a dialog or sidebar or something

consider how streamed media should be dealt with as opposed to local media (like from a plex server)

library and usage statistics (prompt user to enable/disable usage stats on first startup)


## minor/later

button or ability to import media not currently on media drive

on the first time someone sets sort mode to custom OR creates a collection, show a very quick tutorial about how to drag media

go through everything ensuring compatibility with MacOS and Linux

settings: sorting language selection (determines which articles like "The", "A", "An" are ignored for alphabetical sort — currently hardcoded to English)


## Embedded Player

CI/build script to auto-download libmpv-2.dll before `tauri build` so release builds always bundle it

Git LFS for libmpv-2.dll as an alternative to the CI approach — keeps the DLL in the repo without bloating git history
